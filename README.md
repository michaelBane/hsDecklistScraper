**Welcome to the deck database**

This app is currently in pure prototype phase and is not intended to scale. Currently I have about a weeks work invested in this project so expect jankiness ðŸ˜‰.

**Why does this exists?**

1.  To serve as a central hub for new and old wild video content.

2.  To chronicle the history of hearthstone, providing reference points for off-meta deck-builders to build upon.

3.  To help you find something to play with that card you really want to play with, even if its not currently "meta".

**What is it build on?**

I used [tuber](https://github.com/soodoku/tuber) to access the YT API and [python-hearthstone](https://github.com/HearthSim/python-hearthstone) to parse deck-codes, with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) and [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) pulling it all together. This app is built with [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). You can find all the code on [Github](https://github.com/michaelBane/hsDecklistScraper).

**I hope you like it! [Feedback is appreciated!](https://twitter.com/baney64)**
